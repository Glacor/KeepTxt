**KeepTxt**

KeepTxt is a command line note taking app for systems with [GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).

A little background, I decided to removee my notes from the cloud. I moved to a GUI app on Linux but wanted a notes app with command line performance and simplicity. I looked to [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/) from Gina Trapani as inspiration and wrote my own.

KeepTxt runs from the command line and calling it with one argument, a note name, edits the exisiting note or creates a new one. Run keeptxt -h to see the other options.

To install KeepTxt:

    wget https://github.com/getdual/KeepTxt/archive/master.zip
    unzip master.zip
    cd KeepTxt-master
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh

Answer a question and move keeptxt within your path if you don't install it for all users.
