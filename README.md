KeepTxt
-------

**Introduction**

KeepTxt is a command line note taking app. KeepTxt allows you to organize and store your notes, lists, images, and files with the speed and portability of the command line, all while using the text editor of your choice.

**Installation**

To install KeepTxt:

    wget https://github.com/getdual/KeepTxt/archive/master.zip
    unzip master.zip
    cd KeepTxt-master
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh

Answer two questions and the installer creates a notebook in your home directory. You can change the notebook location and default editor in ~/.keeptxt/keeptxt.conf. Finally, move the keeptxt executable somewhere within your path if you don't install it for all users.

**Usage**

KeepTxt runs from the command line and calling it with one argument, a note name, edits the exisiting note or creates a new one.

    keeptxt todo
    keeptxt "Army List"

Run keeptxt -h to see the other options.

**Productivity Tips**

Try these aliases for keeptxt in your ~/.bash_aliases file:

    alias kt='keeptxt'
    alias kl='keeptxt -l'

Use KeepTxt's print function (-p) to create a hardcopy backup of all of your notes.

    keeptxt -p | lp

If you use cloud storage syncing, like Ubuntu One for example, set your nbkLoc in keeptxt.conf to the sync directory to have your notes on every device.

    # Define notebook location
    nbkLoc="$HOME/Ubuntu One"
