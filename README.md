KeepTxt
=======

KeepTxt is a command line note taking app inspired by KeepNote and todo.txt.

A little background, I was using Evernote and I decided to take my notes off the cloud. I moved to KeepNote, but I wanted a command line solution. I looked to todo.txt from Gina Trapani as inspiration and started out to write my own.

KeepTxt runs from the command line and calling it with one argument, a note name, edits the exisiting note or creates a new one. Run keeptxt -h to see the other options.

To install KeepTxt:

    wget 
    cd 
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh

Answer a question and move keeptxt within your path if you don't install it for all users.
